# Lexicase LCS

This code incorporates lexicase parent selection method in Learning Classifier Systems. The base code is derived from Ryan Urbanowicz's implementation of [eLCS] (https://github.com/ryanurbs/eLCS)

## Running the code
<ul>
<li> Few demo datasets taken from the [Penn-ML-Benchmarks](https://github.com/EpistasisLab/penn-ml-benchmarks) used for studying the parent selection techniques are in the `Demo_Datasets` folder </li>
<li> The LCS hyperparameter settings including the parent selection techniques can be set in the Configuration file (`eLCS_Configuration.py`)</li>
</ul> Run the algorithm using `python eLCS_Run.py`
